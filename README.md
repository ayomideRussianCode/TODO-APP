Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
1. Node.js
2. Git

# Step 2: Clone the Repository

3. Navigate into the project folder:
   cd todo-app

   bash
   npm install
   
   This will install:
   - React
   - TailwindCSS
   - TypeScript
   - Axios (for API calls)
   - React Router (for navigation)


#  Step 4: Start the Development Server
1. Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server by running:
   npm start
   
2. The app will automatically open in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`. If it doesnâ€™t, open your browser and navigate to that address.
